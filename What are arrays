 Lesson: What Are Arrays and When Do We Use Them?

 What is an Array?

An array is a collection of elements stored in a specific order. Think of it like a row of boxes, each holding a value.

In most programming languages:
- Arrays (or lists in Python) are used to store multiple values in one variable
- All elements are accessible by index (starting from 0)
- They're useful when you need to group related data and perform operations like sorting, filtering, or looping

When Should You Use Arrays?

Use arrays when:
- You have many values of the same type (like ages, names, prices)
- You want to loop through data
- You need to search, sort, or modify a group of values

 Titanic Dataset Examples Using Arrays

Assume we load `titanic.csv` into a list of dictionaries:
```python
import csv

with open("titanic.csv", newline='', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    data = list(reader)
