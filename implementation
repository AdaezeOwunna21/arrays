# Arrays Practice: Full CRUD with a Passenger List

# Step 1: Create an array (list)
passenger_names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Ethan"]
print("Initial Passenger List:", passenger_names)

# Step 2: Read (Access items)
print("\nAccessing by index:")
print("First passenger:", passenger_names[0])
print("Third passenger:", passenger_names[2])

# Step 3: Create (Add new names)
print("\nAdding new passengers...")
passenger_names.append("Fatima")
passenger_names.append("George")
print("Updated list:", passenger_names)

# Step 4: Read All (Loop through the list)
print("\nPassenger Manifest:")
for name in passenger_names:
    print("- " + name)

# Step 5: Update (Change a name)
print("\nUpdating 'Charlie' to 'Carlos'...")
index = passenger_names.index("Charlie")
passenger_names[index] = "Carlos"
print("List after update:", passenger_names)

# Step 6: Delete (Remove by name or index)
print("\nRemoving 'Bob' and the last passenger...")
passenger_names.remove("Bob")       # remove by value
passenger_names.pop()               # remove last item
print("List after deletion:", passenger_names)

# Step 7: Count and Filter
print("\nPassenger Stats:")
print("Total passengers:", len(passenger_names))

# Filter: names longer than 5 characters
long_names = [name for name in passenger_names if len(name) > 5]
print("Names longer than 5 characters:", long_names)

# Step 8: Sort
passenger_names.sort()
print("\nSorted Passenger List:", passenger_names)
